 MARS
\family default
 Light is a block-level storage replication system for long distances /
 flaky networks under GPL.
 It runs as a Linux kernel module.
 The sysadmin interface is similar to DRBD

\end_inset

, but its internal engine is completely different from DRBD: it works with
 
\series bold
transaction logging
\series default
, similar to some database systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Therefore, MARS Light can provide stronger 
\series bold
consistency guarantees
\series default
.
 Even in case of network bottlenecks / problems / failures, the secondaries
 may become outdated (reflect an elder state), but never become inconsistent.
 In contrast to DRBD, MARS Light preserves the 
\series bold
order of write operations
\series default
 even when the network is flaky (
\series bold
Anytime Consistency
\series default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The current version of MARS Light works 
\series bold
asynchronously
\series default
.
 Therefore, application performance is completely decoupled from any network
 problems.
 Future versions are planned to also support synchronous or near-synchronous
 modes.

\begin_layout Standard
DRBD has a long history of successfully providing HA features to many users
 of Linux.
 With the advent of MARS, many people are wondering what the difference
 is.
 They ask for recommendations.
 In which use cases should DRBD be recommended, and in which other cases
 is MARS the better choice?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There exist 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 cases where DRBD is better than MARS.
 1&1 has a long history of experiences with DRBD where it works very fine,
 in particular coupling Linux devices rack-to-rack via crossover cables.
 DRBD is just 
\emph on
constructed
\emph default
 for that use case (RAID-1 over network).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, there exist other cases where DRBD did not work as expected,
 leading to incidents and other operational problems.
 We analyzed them for those use cases, and found that they could only be
 resolved by fundamental changes in the overall architecture of DRBD.
 Therefore, we started the development of MARS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MARS and DRBD simply have 
\series bold
different application areas
\series default
.

\begin_layout Standard
In the following, we will discuss the pros and cons of each system in particular
 situations and contexts, and we shed some light at their conceptual and
 operational differences.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to describe the most important problem we found when DRBD was used
 to couple whole datacenters (each encompassing thousands of servers) over
 metro distances, we strip down that complicated real-life scenario to a
 simplified laboratory scenario in order to demonstrate the effect with
 minimal means.
 The following picture illustrates an effect which is not only observable
 in practice, but is also reproducible by the MARS test suite
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The effect has been demonstrated with DRBD version 8.3.13.
 By construction, is is independent from any of the DRBD series 8.3.x, 8.4.x,
 or 9.0.x.
\end_layout

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Graphics

	width 80col%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The simplified scenario is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
DRBD is loaded with a low to medium, but constant rate of write operations
 for the sake of simplicity of the scenario.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The network has some throughput bottleneck, depicted as a red line.
 For the sake of simplicity, we just linearly decrease it over time, starting
 from full throughput, down to zero.
 The decrease is very slowly over time (some minutes, or even hours).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What will happen in this scenario?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As long as the actual DRBD write throughput is lower than the network bandwidth
 (left part of the horizontal blue line), DRBD works as expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the maximum network throughput (red line) starts to fall short of the
 required application throughput (first blue dotted line), we get into trouble.
 By its very nature, DRBD works 
\series bold
synchronously
\series default
.
 Therefore, it 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 transfer all your application writes through the bottleneck, but now it
 is impossible
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is independent from the DRBD protocols A through C, because it just
 depends on an information-theoretic argument independently from any protocol.
 We have a fundamental conflict between network capabilities and application
 demands here, which cannot be circumvented due to the 
\series bold
synchronous
\series default
 nature of DRBD.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 due to the bottleneck.
 As a consequence, the application running on top of DRBD will see increasingly
 higher IO latencies and/or stalls / hangs.
 We found practical cases (at least with former versions of DRBD) where
 IO latencies exceeded practical monitoring limits such as 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 s by far, up to the range of 
\emph on
minutes
\emph default
.
 As an experienced sysadmin, you know what happens next: your application
 will run into an incident, and your customers will be dissatisfied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to deal with such situations, DRBD has lots of tuning parameters.
 In particular, the 
\family typewriter
timeout
\family default
 parameter and/or the 
\family typewriter
ping-timeout
\family default
 parameter will determine when DRBD will give up in such a situation and
 simply drop the network connection as an emergency measure.
 Dropping the network connection is roughly equivalent to an automatic 
\family typewriter
disconnect
\family default
, followed by an automatic re-connect attempt after 
\family typewriter
connect-int
\family default
 seconds.
 During the dropped connection, the incident will appear as being resolved,
 but at some hidden cost
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
By appropriately tuning various DRBD parameters, such as 
\family typewriter
timeout
\family default
 and/or 
\family typewriter
ping-timeout
\family default
, you can keep the impact of the incident below some viable limit.
 However, the automatic disconnect will then happen earlier and more often
 in practice.
 Flaky or overloaded networks may easily lead to an enormous number of automatic
 disconnects.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What happens next in our scenario? During the 
\family typewriter
disconnect
\family default
, DRBD will record all positions of writes in its bitmap and/or in its activity
 log.
 As soon as the automatic re-connect succeeds after 
\family typewriter
connect-int
\family default
 seconds, DRBD has to do a partial re-sync of those blocks which were marked
 dirty in the meantime.
 This leads to an 
\emph on
additional
\emph default
 bandwidth demand
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
DRBD parameters 
\family typewriter
sync-rate
\family default
 resp 
\family typewriter

\family default
 may be used to tune the height of the additional demand.
 In addition, the newer parameters 
\family typewriter

\family default
, 
\family typewriter
c-fill-target
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
c-delay-target
\family default

\family typewriter
c-max-rate
\family default
 and friends may be used to dynamically adapt to 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 situations where the application throughput 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 fit through the bottleneck.
 These newer parameters were developed in a cooperation between 1&1 and
 Linbit, the maker of DRBD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Please note that lowering / dynamically adapting the resync rates may help
 in lowering the 
\emph on
probability
\emph default
 of occurrences of the above problems in practical scenarios where the bottlenec
k would recover to viable limits after some time.
 However, lowering the rates will also increase the 
\emph on
duration
\emph default
 of re-sync operations accordingly.
 The 
\emph on
total amount of re-sync data
\emph default
 simply does not decrease when lowering 
\family typewriter
resync-rate
\family default
; it even tends to increase over time when new requests arrive.
 Therefore, the 
\emph on
expectancy value
\emph default
 of problems caused by 
\emph on
strong
\emph default
 network bottlenecks (i.e.
 when not even the ordinary application rate is fitting through) is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 improved by lowering or adapting 
\family typewriter
resync-rate
\family default
, but rather the expectancy value mostly depends on the 
\emph on
relation
\emph default
 between the amount of holdback data versus the amount of application write
 data, both measured for the duration of some given strong bottleneck.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 as indicated by the upper dotted blue box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, there is 
\emph on
absolutely no chance
\emph default
 to get the increased amount of data through our bottleneck, since not even
 the ordinary application load (lower dotted lines) could be transferred.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, you run at a 
\series bold
very high risk
\series default
 that the re-sync cannot finish before the next 
\family typewriter
timeout
\family default
 / 
\family typewriter
ping-timeout
\family default
 cycle will drop the network connection again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What will be the final result when that risk becomes true? Simply, your
 secondary site will be 
\emph on
permanently
\emph default
 in state 
\family typewriter
inconsistent
\family default
.
 This means, you have lost your redundancy.
 In our scenario, there is no chance at all to become consistent again,
 because the network bottleneck declines more and more, slowly.
 It is simply 
\emph on
hopeless
\emph default
, by construction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case you lose your primary site now, you are lost at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some people may argue that the probability for a similar scenario were low.
 We don't agree on such an argumentation.
 Not only because it really happens in pratice, and it may even last some
 days until problems are fixed.
 In case of 
\series bold
rolling disasters
\series default
, the network is very likely to become flaky and/or overloaded shortly before
 the final damage.
 Even in other cases, you can easily end up with inconsistent secondaries.
 It occurs not only in the lab, but also in practice if you operate some
 hundreds or even thousands of DRBD instances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point is that you can produce an ill behaviour 
\emph on
systematically
\emph default
 just by overloading the network a bit for some sufficient duration.

 When coupling whole datacenters via some thousands of DRBD connections,
 any (short) network loss will almost certainly increase the re-sync network
 load each time the outage appears to be over.
 As a consequence, overload may be 
\emph on
provoked
\emph default
 by the re-sync repair attempts.
 This may easily lead to self-amplifying 
\series bold
throughput storms
\series default
 in some resonance frequency (similar to self-destruction of a bridge when
 an army is marching over it in lockstep).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only way for reliable prevention of loss of secondaries is to start
 any re-connect 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 in such situations where you can 
\emph on
predict in advance
\emph default
 that the re-sync is 
\emph on
guaranteed
\emph default
 to finish before any network bottleneck / loss will cause an automatic
 disconnect again.
 We don't know of any method which can reliably predict the future behaviour
 of a complex network.

 desperately need them.

 Linbit recommends a 
\series bold
workaround
\series default
 for the inconsistencies during re-sync: LVM snapshots.
 We tried it, but found a 
\emph on
performance penalty
\emph default
 which made it prohibitive for our concrete application.
 A problem seems to be the cost of destroying snapshots.
 LVM uses by default a BOW strategy (Backup On Write, which is the counterpart
 of COW = Copy On Write).
 BOW increases IO latencies during ordinary operation.
 Retaining snapshots is cheap, but reverting them may be very costly, depending
 on workload.
 We didn't fully investigate that effect, and our experience is a few years
 old.
 You might come to a different conclusion for a different workload, for
 newer versions of system software, or for a different strategy if you carefully
 investigate the field.

When the network is restrained, an asynchronous system like MARS will continue

 Here is one point in favour of DRBD: MARS stores its transaction logs on
 the filesystem 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
.
 When the network bottleneck is lasting very long (some days or even some
 weeks), the filesystem will eventually run out of space some day.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Defending-Overflow"

\end_inset

 discusses countermeasures against that in detail.
 In contrast to MARS, DRBD allocates its bitmap 
\emph on
statically
\emph default
 at resource creation time.
 It uses up less space, and you don't have to monitor it for (potential)
 overflows.
 The space for transaction logs is the price you have to pay if you want
 or need anytime consistency, or asynchronous replication in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to really grasp the 
\emph on
heart
\emph default
 of the difference between synchronous and asynchronous replication, we
 look at the following modified scenario:

This time, the network throughput (red line) is varying
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In real life, many long-distance lines or even some heavily used metro lines
 usually show fluctuations of their network bandwidth by an order of magnitude,
 or even higher.
 We have measured them.
 The overall behaviour can be characterized as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\end_inset

 in some unpredictable way.
 As before, the application throughput served by MARS is assumed to be constant
 (dotted green line, often superseded by the solid green line).
 The actual replication network throughput is depicted by the solid green
 line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see, a network dropdown undershooting the application demand
 has no impact on the application throughput, but only on the replication
 network throughput.
 Whenever the network throughput is held back due to the flaky network,
 it simply catches up as soon as possible by overshooting the application
 throughput.
 The amount of lag-behind is visualized as shaded area: downward shading
 (below the application throughput) means an increase of the lag-behind,
 while the upwards shaded areas (beyond the application throughput) indicate
 a decrease of the lag-behind (catch-up).
 Once the lag-behind has been fully caught up, the network throughput suddenly
 jumps back to the application throughput (here visible in two cases).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset Graphics

 Note that the existence of lag-behind areas is roughly corresponding to
 DRBD disconnect states, and in turn to DRBD inconsistent states of the
 secondary as long as the lag-behind has not been fully cought up.
 The very rough

Of course, this visualization is not exact.
 On one hand, the DRBD inconsistency phase may start later as depicted here,
 because it only starts 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 the first automatic disconnect, upon the first automatic re-connect.
 In addition, the amount of resync data may be smaller than the amount of
 corresponding MARS transaction logfile data, because the DRBD bitmap will
 coalesce multiple writes to the same block into one single transfer.
 On the other hand, DRBD will transfer no data at all during its disconnected
 state, while MARS continues its best.
 This leads to a prolongation of the DRBD inconsistent phase.
 Depending on properties of the workload and of the network, the real duration
 of the inconsistency phase may be both shorter or longer.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 duration of the corresponding DRBD inconsistency phase is visualized as
 magenta line at the time scale.

MARS utilizes the existing network bandwidth as best as possible in order
 to pipe through as much data as possible, provided that there exists some
 data requiring expedition.
 Conceptually, there exists no better way due to information theoretic limits
 (besides data compression).

In case of lag-behind, the version of the data replicated to the secondary
 site corresponds to some time in the past.
 Since the data is always transferred in the same order as originally submitted
 at the primary site, the secondary never gets inconsistent.
 Your mirror always remains usable.
 Your only potential problem could be the outdated state, corresponding
 to some state in the past.
 However, the

Conclusion: you can even use

traffic shaping

 on MARS' TCP connections in order to globally balance your network throughput

 If you would try to do the same with DRBD, you could easily provoke a disaster.
 MARS simply tolerates any network problems, provided that there is enough
 disk space for transaction logfiles.
 Even in case of completely filling up your disk with transaction logfiles
 after some days or weeks, you will not lose local consistency anywhere
 (see section

This time, the network throughput limit (solid red line) is assumed to be
 constant.
 However, the application workload (dotted green line) shows some heavy
 peaks.
 We know from our 1&1 datacenters that such an application behaviour is
 very common.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the peaks are exceeding the network capabilities for some time, the
 replication network throughput (solid green line) will be limited for a
 short time, stay a little bit longer at the limit, and finally drop down
 again to the normal workload.
 In other words, you get a flexible buffering behaviour, coping with the
 peaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar scenarios (where both the application workload has peaks and the
 network is flaky to some degree) are rather common.
 If you would use DRBD there, you were likely to run into regular application
 performance problems and/or frequent automatic disconnect cycles, depending
 on the height and on the duration of the peaks, and on network resources.

Long Distances / High Latencies

In general and in some theories, latencies are conceptually independent
 from throughput, at least to some degree.
 There exist all 4 possible combinations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There exist lines with high latencies but also high throughput.
 Examples are raw fibre cables at the ground of the Atlantic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
High latencies on low-throughput lines is very easy to achieve.
 If you never saw it, you never ran interactive 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Low latencies need not be incompatible with high throughput.
 See Myrinet, InfiniBand or high-speed point-to-point interconnects, such
 as modern memory busses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Low latency combined with low throughput is also possible: in an ATM system
 (or another pre-reservation system for bandwidth), just increase the multiplex
 factor on low-capacity but short lines, which is only possible at the cost
 of assigned bandwidth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 
\emph on
internet
\emph default
 practice, however, it is very likely that high latencies will also lead
 to worse throughput, because of the 
\emph on
congestion control algorithms
\emph default
 running all over the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have experimented with extremely large TCP send/receive buffers plus
 various window sizes and congestion control algorithms over long-distance
 lines between the USA and Europe.
 Yes, it is possible to improve the behaviour to some degree.
 But magic does not happen.
 Natural laws will always hold.
 You simply cannot travel faster than the speed of light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our experience leads to the following rule of thumb, not formally proven
 by anything, but just observed in practice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
In general, synchronous data replication (not limited to applications of
 DRBD) works reliably only over distances 
\begin_inset Formula $<50$
\end_inset

 km.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There may be some exceptions, at least when dealing with low-end workstation
 loads.
 But when you are responsible for a whole datacenter and/or some centralized
 storage units, don't waste your time by trying (almost) impossible things.
 We recommend to use MARS in such use cases.

Higher Consistency Guarantees vs Actuality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We already saw in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 that certain types of network bottlenecks can easily (and reproducibly)
 destroy the consistency of your DRBD secondary, while MARS will preserve
 local consistency at the cost of actuality (
\series bold

\series default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some people, often located at database operations, are obtrusively arguing
 that actuality is such a high good that it must not be sacrificed under
 any circumstances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyone arguing this way has at least the following choices (list may be
 incomplete):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
None of the above use cases for MARS apply.
 For instance, short distance replication over crossover cables is sufficient
 (which occurs very often), or the network is reliable enough such that
 bottlenecks can never occur (e.g.
 because the total load is extremely low, or conversely the network is extremely
 overengineered / expensive), or the occurrence of bottlenecks can 
\emph on
provably
\emph default
 be taken into account.
 In such cases, DRBD is clearly the better solution than MARS, because it
 provides better actuality than the current version of MARS, and it uses
 up less disk resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the presence of network bottlenecks, people didn't notice and/or didn't
 understand and/or did under-estimate the risk of accidental invalidation
 of their DRBD secondaries.
 They should carefully check that risk.
 They should convince themselves that the risk is 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 bearable.
 Once they are hit by a systematic chain of events which 
\emph on

In the presence of network bottlenecks, people found a solution such that

 DRBD is even drastically worse than that of MARS (in the same situation).
 It is true that DRBD provides better actuality in

 So it is difficult to judge the risks.
 Possibly a chance is inspection of DRBD messages in the syslog, but quantificat

\end_layout

 So they didn't notice that their argumentation on the importance of actuality
 may be fundamentally wrong.
 A possible way to overcome that may be re-reading section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and comparing its outcome with the corresponding outcome of DRBD in the

A common misunderstanding is about the actuality guarantees provided by
 filesystems.
 The buffer cache / page cache uses by default a

 for performance reasons.
 Even modern journalling filesystems will (by default) provide only consistency
 guarantees, but no strong actuality guarantee.
 In case of power loss, some transactions may be even

 According to POSIX

 them!

MARS' tolerance of networking problems comes with some cost.
 You will need some extra space for the transaction logfiles of MARS, residing

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exact space requirements for

 depend on the

average write rate
\emph default

 We found that only few applications are writing more than 1 TB per day.
 Most are writing even less than 100 GB per day.
 Usually, you want to dimension

 such that you can survive a network loss lasting 3 days / about one weekend.
 This can be achieved with current technology rather easily: as a simple
 rule of thumb, just use one

 Typically, that will provide you with plenty of headroom even for bigger
 networking incidents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dedicated disks for 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 have another advantage: their mechanical head movement is completely independen

 For best performance, attach that dedicated disk to your hardware RAID

If you are concerned about reliability, use two disks switched together

\begin_layout Standard
As explained in section

\end_inset

, all changes to your resource data are recorded in transaction logfiles
 residing on the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem.
 These files are always growing over time.
 In order to avoid filesystem overflow, the following must be done in regular
 time intervals:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
marsadm log-rotate all
\family default

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This starts appending to a new logfile on all of your resources.
 The logfiles are automatically numbered by an increasing 9-digit logfile
 number.
 This will suffice for many centuries even if you would logrotate once a
 minute.
 Practical frequencies for logfile rotation are more like once an hour
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Under 
\emph on
extremely
\emph default
 high load conditions, you might want to log-rotate serveral times an hour,
 in order to keep the size of each logfile under some practical limit.
 At 1&1 datacenters, we have not yet encountered conditions where that was

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
marsadm log-delete-all all

This determines all logfiles from all resources which are no longer needed
 (i.e.
 which are

 All superfluous logfiles are then deleted, including all copies on all

 The current version of MARS deletes either 
\emph on
all

 replicas of a logfile everywhere, or 
\emph on
none

 of the replicas.
 This is a simple rule, but has the drawback that one node may hinder other
 nodes from freeing space in 
\family typewriter

\family default
.
 In particular, the command 
\family typewriter
marsadm pause-replay $res
\family default
 (as well as

 to fail.
 If you want to 
\emph on
ensure
\emph default
 that no split brain can result from intended primary switching, please
 give the 
\family typewriter
primary

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the usage check for

 Since MARS is operating asynchronously (in contrast to DRBD), it may take
 some time until our node knows that the device is no longer used at another
 node.
 This can lead to a race condition if you automate an intended takeover
 with a script like 
\family typewriter
ssh A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; ssh B 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 because your second ssh command may be faster than the internal MARS symlink
 tree propagation (cf section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Symlink-Tree"

\end_inset

).
 In order to prevent such races, you should use the command
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm wait-umount mydata
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
on node B before trying to become primary.
 The script should look like

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to DRBD, split brain situations are handled differently by MARS
 Light.
 When two primaries are accidentally active at the same time, each of them
 writes into different logfiles 
\family typewriter
/mars/resource-mydata/log-000000001-A
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
/mars/resource-mydata/log-000000001-B

 where the 
\emph on
origin
\emph default
 host is always recorded in the filename.
 Therefore, both nodes 
\emph on
can theoretically
\emph default
 run in primary mode independently from each other, at least for some time.
 They might even 
\family typewriter
log-rotate
\family default
 independently from each other.
 However, the replication will certainly get stuck, and your 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem will eventually run out of space.
 Any other secondary node will certainly get into serious problems: it simply
 does not not know which split-brain version it should follow.
 Therefore, you will certainly loose your redundancy.

 When one of your multiple split brain nodes has left its actual primary
 role, e.g.
 via 
\family typewriter
marsadm secondary
\family default
 and umounting its 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 device while the network is up (again), we cannot guarantee that it is
 always possible to re-enter primary mode again, even when 
\family typewriter

 Therefore it is

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Split brain situations are detected

 Whenever a secondary detects that somewhere a split brain has happend,

\begin_layout Standard
As before, do the 
\family typewriter
leave-resource
\family default
 step on each node and check that the split brain has gone, but omit the
 re-creation.
 You may just follow-up a 
\family typewriter
join-resource
\family default
 to the old resource name instead, in order to restore your redundancy by
 overwriting your bad split brain version with the correct one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, you may try the following short procedure instead, which
 is however not guaranteed to resolve all (desperate) split-brain situations
 (see documentation of

 When all wrong versions have disappeared from the cluster (either by

 resume tracking of the new unique version.

MARS Light does its best to recover even from multiple failures (e.g.

 Chances are high that the previous instructions will work even in case
 of multiple failures, such as a network failure plus local node failure
 at only 1 node (even if that node is the former primary node).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, in general (e.g.
 when more than 1 node is damaged) there is no general guarantee that recovery
 will

 succeed under 
\emph on
any

It should be very hard to finally trash a secondary, because the transaction
 logfiles are containing 
\family typewriter
md5
\family default
 checksums for all data records.
 Any attempt to apply currupted logfiles is refused by MARS.
 In addition, the sequence numbers of log-rotated logfiles are checked for
 contiguity.
 Finally, the 
\emph on
sequence path
\emph default
 of logfile applications (consisting of logfile names plus their respective
 length) is additionally secured by a 
\family typewriter
git
\family default
-like incremental checksum over the whole path (so-called

 This should detect split brains even if logfiles are appended / modified

 a (forceful) switchover has already taken place.

 for final loss of data are very high if you remove the BBU of your hardware

 Therefore, never try to

 a seemingly dead node before your replication is up again somewhere else!
 Only unplug the network cables when advised, but never try to repair the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case of desperate situations where none of the previous instructions
 have succeeded, your last chance is rebuilding your resource from an intact
 disk as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Do 
\family typewriter
rmmod mars
\family default
 on all your cluster nodes and/or reboot them.
 Note: if you are less desperate, chances are high that the following will
 also work when the kernel module remains active and everywhere a 
\family typewriter
marsadm down
\family default
 is given instead, but for an 
\emph on
ultimate
\emph default
 instruction you should eliminate 
\emph on
potential
\emph default
 kernel problems by 
\family typewriter
rmmod
\family default
 / 
\family typewriter
reboot
\family default
, at least if you can afford the downtime on concurrently operating resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For safety, physically remove the storage network cables on 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 your cluster nodes.
 Note: the same disclaimer holds.
 MARS really does its best, even when 
\family typewriter
delete-resource
\family default
 is given while the network is fully active and multiple split-brain primaries
 are actively using their local device in parallel (approved by some testcases
 from the automatic test suite, but note that it is impossible to catch
 all possible failure scenarios).
 Don't challenge your fate if you are desperate! Don't 
\emph on
rely
\emph default
 on this! Nothing is absolutely fail-safe!

Do

 If that fails,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If your old 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 works, and you did not already (forcefully) switch your designated primary
 to the final destination, do it now (see description in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally, do all the

s on the respective cluster nodes, according to your new redundancy scenario
 after the failures (e.g.
 after activating spare nodes, etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you can choose how the rebuild your cluster.
 If you rebuilt 
\family typewriter

 anywhere, you should do the same on all other (surviving) cluster nodes
 and start over with a fresh

Of course, when you don't have created the

 had not been propagated to other nodes before.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 You might accidentally destroy your again-working copy!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before re-connecting any network cable on any non-primary (new secondaries),
 ensure that all 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 devices are no longer in use (e.g.
 from an old primary role before the incident happened), and that each local
 disk is detached.
 Only after that, you should be able to safely re-connect the network.
 The 
\family typewriter
delete-resource
\family default
 given at the new primary should propagate now to each of your secondaries,
 and your local disk should be usable for a re-

When you did not rebuild your cluster from scratch with fresh

leave-resource

Basic Working Principle

When taking this naïvely, you could easily step into some trivial pitfalls,
 because the internal working principle of MARS is totally different from
 DRBD.
 Please forget (almost) anything you already know about the internal working

The basic idea of MARS is to record all changes made to your block device
 in a so-called 
\series bold
transaction logfile
\series default
.
 
\emph on
Any
\emph default
 write reqeuest is treated like a transaction which changes the contents
 of your block device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is similar in concept to some database systems, but there exists no
 separate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 operation: 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 write request is acting like a commit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The picture shows the flow of write requests.
 Let's start with the primary node.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon submission of a write request on 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
, it is first buffered in a 
\emph on
temporary
\emph default
 memory buffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The temporary memory buffer serves multiple purposes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It keeps track of the order of write operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Additionally, it keeps track of the positions in the underlying disk 
\family typewriter
/dev/lv-x/mydata
\family default
.
 In particular, it detects when the same block is overwritten multiple times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
During pending write operation, any concurrent reads are served from the
 memory buffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the write has been buffered in the temporary memory buffer, the main
 logger thread of the transaction logger creates a so-called 
\emph on
log entry
\emph default
 and starts an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

append
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 operation on the transaction logfile.
 The log entry contains vital information such as the logical block number
 in the underlying disk, the length of the data, a timestamp, some header
 magic in order to detect corruption, the log entry sequence number, of
 course the data itself, and optional information like a checksum or compression
 information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the log entry has been written through to the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem via fsync(), the application waiting for the write operation
 at 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 is signalled that the write was successful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This may happen even 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 the writeback to the underlying disk 
\family typewriter
/dev/lv-x/mydata
\family default
 has started.
 Even when you power off the system right now, the information is not lost:
 it is present in the logfile, and can be reconstructed from there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the order of log records present in the transaction log defines
 a total order among the write requests which is 
\emph on
compatible
\emph default
 to the partial order of write requests issued on 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also notice that despite its sequential nature, the transaction logfile
 is typically 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 the performance bottleneck of the system: since appending to a logfile
 is almost purely sequential IO, it runs much faster than random IO on typical
 datacenter workloads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to reclaim the temporary memory buffer, its content must be written
 back to the underlying disk 
\family typewriter
/dev/lv-x/mydat
\family default
a somewhen.
 After writeback, the temporary space is freed.
 The writeback can do the following optimizations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
writeback may be in 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 order; in particular, it may be 
\emph on
sorted
\emph default
 according to ascending sector ´numbers.
 This will reduce the average seek distances of magnetic disks in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
when the same sector is overwritten multiple times, only the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

last
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 version need to be written back, skipping some intermediate versions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case the primary node crashes during writeback, it suffices to replay
 the log entries from some point in the past until the end of the transaction
 logfile.
 It does no harm if you accidentally replay some log entries twice or even
 more often: since the replay is in the original total order, any temporary
 inconsistency is 
\emph on
healed
\emph default
 by the logfile application.
\end_layout

In mathematics, the property that you can apply your logfile twice to your
 data (or even as often as you want), is called 
\series bold
idempotence
\series default
.
 This is a very desirable property: it ensures that nothing goes wrong when
 applying

\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Idempotence is even more beneficial: in case anything should go wrong with
 your data on your disk (e.g.
 IO errors), applying your logfile once more often may

 some defects.
 Good news for desperate sysadmins forced to work with flaky hardware!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea of the asynchronous replication of MARS is rather simple:
 just transfer the logfiles to your secondary nodes, and apply them to their
 copy of the disk data (also called 
\emph on
mirror
\emph default
) in the same order as the total order defined by the primary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, a mirror of your data on any secondary may be outdated, but it
 always corresponds to some version which was valid in the past.
 This property is called 
\series bold
anytime consistency
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Your secondary nodes are always consistent in themselves.
 Notice that this kind of consistency is a 
\emph on
local
\emph default
 consistency model.
 There exists no global consistency in MARS.
 Global consistency would be practically impossible in long-distance replication
 where Einstein's law of the speed of light is limiting global consistency.

As you can see in the picture, the process of transfering the logfiles is
 
\emph on
independent
\emph default
 from the process which applies the logfiles to the data at some secondary
 site.
 Both processes can be switched on / off separately (see commands

 This may be

exploited
\emph default
: for example, you may replicate your logfiles as soon as possible (to protect
 against catastrophic failures), but deliberately wait one hour until it
 is applied (under regular circumstances).
 If your data inside your filesystem

 clock.
 MARS uses a special variant called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

physical Lamport clock
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The physical Lamport clock is another almost-realtime clock which 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 run independently from the Linux kernel system clock.
 However, the Lamport clock tries to remain as near as possible to the system
 clock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both clocks can be queried at any time via 
\family typewriter
cat /proc/sys/mars/lamport_clock
\family default
.
 The result will show both clocks in parallel, in units of seconds since
 the Unix epoch, with nanosecond resolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When there are no network messages at all, both the system clock and the
 Lamport clock will show almost the same time (except some minor differences
 of a few nanoseconds resulting from the finite processor clock speed).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The physical Lamport clock works rather simple: 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 message on the network is augmented with a Lamport time stamp telling when
 the message was 
\emph on
sent
\emph default
 according to the local Lamport clock of the sender.
 Whenever that message is received by some receiver, it checks whether the
 time ordering relation would be violated: whenever the Lamport timestamp
 in the message would claim that the sender had sent it 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 it arrived at the receiver (according to drifts in their respective local
 clocks), something must be wrong.
 In this case, the local Lamport clock of the 
\emph on
receiver
\emph default
 is advanced shortly after the sender Lamport timestamp, such that the time
 ordering relation is no longer violated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence, any local Lamport clock may precede the corresponding
 local system clock.
 In order to avoid accumulation of deltas between the Lamport and the system
 clock, the Lamport clock will run slower after that, possibly until it
 reaches the system clock again (if no other message arrives which sets
 it forward again).
 After having reached the system clock, the Lamport clock will continue
 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MARS uses the local Lamport clock for anything where other systems would
 use the local system clock: for example, timestamp generation in the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem.
 Even symlinks created there are timestamped according to the Lamport clock.
 Both the kernel module and the userspace tool 
\family typewriter
marsadm
\family default
 are always operating in the timescale of the Lamport clock.
 Most importantly, all timestamp comparisons are always carried out with
 respect to Lamport time.

 Bigger differences between the Lamport and the system clock can be annoying
 from a human point of view: when typing 
\family typewriter
ls -l /mars/resource-mydata/
\family default
 many timestamps may appear as if they were created in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

future
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, because the 
\family typewriter
ls
\family default
 command compares the output formatting against the system clock (it does
 not even know of the existence of the MARS Lamport clock).

 Always use 
\family typewriter
ntp
\family default
 (or another clock synchronization service) in order to pre-synchronize
 your system clocks as close as possible.
 Bigger differences are not only annoying, but may lead some people to wrong
 conclusions and therefore even lead to bad human decisions!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a professional datacenter, you should use

 anyway, and you should monitor its effectiveness anyway.

Hint: many internal logfiles produced by the MARS kernel module contain
 Lamport timestamps written as numerical values.
 In order to convert them into human-readable form, use the command

Therefrom results a fundamentally different behaviour than DRBD.
 When your DRBD primary crashed before and now comes up again, you have
 to setup DRBD again by a sequence of commands like 
\family typewriter
modprobe drbd; drbdadm up all; drbdadm primary all
\family default
 or similar.
 In contrast, MARS needs only 
\family typewriter
modprobe mars
\family default
 (after 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 has been mounted by 
\family typewriter
/etc/fstab
\family default
).
 The 
\emph on
persistence
\emph default
 of the symlinks residing in 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 will automatically remember your previous state, even if some your resources
 were primary while others were secondary (mixed operations).
 You don't need to do any actions in order to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

restore
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a previous state, no matter how 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

complex
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Almost) all symlinks appearing in the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 directory tree are automatically replicated thoughout the whole cluster.
 Thus the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 directory forms some kind of 
\emph on
global namespace
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the symlink replication works generically, you may use the 
\family typewriter
/mars/userspace/
\family default
 directory in order to place your own symlink there (for whatever purpose,
 which need not have to do with MARS).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to avoid name clashes, each symlink created at node A should have
 the name A in its path name.
 Typically, internal MARS names follow the scheme 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\emph on
something
\emph default
/myname-A
\family default
, and you should follow the best practice of systematically using 
\family typewriter
/mars/userspace/myname-A
\family default
 or similar.
 As a result, each node will automatically get informed about the state
 at any other node, like B when the corresponding information is recorded
 on node B under the name 
\family typewriter
/mars/userspace/myname-B
\family default
 (context-dependent names).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

	filename /usr/share/clipart/openclipart-0.18/electronics/bulb/lightbulb_brightlit_benj_.png
	lyxscale 12
	scale 7

\end_inset

Important: the convention of placing the 
\series bold
creator host name
\series default
 inside your symlink names should be used wherever possible.
 The name part is a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ownership indicator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is crucial that no other host writes any symlink not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

belonging
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to him.
 Other hosts may read foreign symlinks as often as they want, but never
 modify them.
 This way, your cluster nodes are able to 
\emph on
communicate
\emph default
 with each other via symlink updates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although you may create (and change) your symlinks with userspace tools
 like 
\family typewriter
ln -s
\family default
, you should use the following marsadm commands instead:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm set-link myvalue /mars/userspace/mykey-A
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
marsadm delete-file /mars/userspace/mykey-A
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two reasons for this: first, the 
\family typewriter
marsadm set-link
\family default
 command will automatically use the Lamport clock for symlink creation,
 and therefore will avoid any errors resulting from a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wrong
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 system clock (as in 
\family typewriter
ln -s
\family default
).
 Second, the 
\family typewriter
marsadm delete-file
\family default
 (which also deletes symlinks) works on the 
\emph on
whole cluster
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's the difference? If you try to remove your symlink locally by hand
 via 
\family typewriter
rm -f
\family default
, you will be surprised: since the symlink has been replicated to other
 cluster nodes, it will be re-transferred from there and will be resurrected
 locally after some short time.
 This way, you cannot delete any object reliably, because your whole cluster
 (which may consist of many nodes) remembers all your state information
 and will resurrect it whenever 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

necessary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to solve the deletion problem, MARS Light uses some internal deletion
 protocol using auxiliary symlinks residing in 
\family typewriter
/mars/todo-global/.

\family default
 The deletion protocol ensures that all replicas get deleted in the whole
 cluster, and only after that the auxiliary symlinks in 
\family typewriter
/mars/todo-global/
\family default
 are also deleted eventually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may change your already existing symlink via 
\family typewriter
marsadm set-link some-other-value /mars/userspace/mykey-A
\family default
 .
 The new value will be propagated in the cluster according to a 
\series bold
timestamp comparison protocol
\series default
: whenever node B notices that A has a 
\emph on
newer
\emph default
 version of some symlink (according to the Lamport timestamp), it will replace
 its elder version by the newer one.
 The opposite does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 work: if B notices that A has an elder version, just nothing happens.
 This way, the timestamps of symlinks can only progress in forward direction,
 but never backwards in time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence, symlink updates made 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

by hand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 via 
\family typewriter
ln -s
\family default
 may get lost when the local system clock is much more earlier than the
 Lamport clock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When your cluster is fully connected by the network, the last timestamp
 will finally win everywhere.
 Only in case of network outages leading to 
\emph on
network partitions
\emph default
, some information may be 
\emph on
temporarily inconsistent
\emph default
, but only for the duration of the network outage.
 The timestamp comparison protocol in combination with the Lamport clock
 and with the persistence of the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem will automatically heal any temporary inconsistencies as soon
 as possible, even in case of temporary node shutdown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The meaning of the internal MARS Light symlinks residing in 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 is documented in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
This section describes an important difference to DRBD.
 The metadata of DRBD is allocated 
\emph on
statically
\emph default
 at 
\emph on
creation
\emph default
 
\emph on
time
\emph default
 of the resource.
 In contrast, the MARS transaction logfiles are allocated 
\emph on
dynamically
\emph default
 at 
\emph on
runtime
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This leads to a potential risk from the perspective of a sysadmin: what
 happens if the 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 filesystem runs out of space?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No risk, no fun.
 If you want a system which survives long-lasting network outages while
 keeping your replicas always consistent (anytime consistency), you 
\emph on
need
\emph default
 dynamic memory for that.
 It is 
\emph on
impossible
\emph default
 to solve that problem using static memory
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The bitmaps used by DRBD don't preserve the 
\emph on
order
\emph default
 of write operations.
 They cannot do that, because their space is 
\begin_inset Formula $O(k)$
\end_inset

 for some constant 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 In contrast, MARS preserves the order.
 Preserving the order as such (even when only 
\emph on
facts
\emph default
 about the order were recorded without recording the actual data contents)
 requires 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n)$
\end_inset

 space where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is infinitely growing over time.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, DRBD and MARS have different application areas.
 If you just want a simple system for mirroring your data over short distances
 like a crossover cable, DRBD will be a suitable choice.
 However, if you need to replicate over longer distances, or if you need
 higher levels of reliability even when multiple failures may accumulate
 (such as network loss during a 
\emph on
re
\emph default
sync of DRBD), the transaction logs of MARS can solve that, but at some
 
\emph on
cost
\emph default
.

Motivation: in rare cases, some users with

very

 silly things.
 For example, some of them are creating their own backups via user-cron

 Some example guy created a zip archive (almost 1GB) by regularly copying
 his old zip archive into a new one, then appending deltas to the new one,
 and finally deleting the old archive.
 Every 5 minutes.
 Yes, every 5 minutes, although almost never any new files were added to
 the archive.
 Essentially, he copied over his archive, for nothing.
 This led to massive bulk write requests, for ridiculous reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, your hard disks (or even RAID systems) allow much higher write
 IO rates than you can ever transport over a standard TCP network from your
 primary site to your secondary, at least over longer distances (see use
 cases for MARS in chapter

\end_layout

Notice that DRBD will

 Typical values for this are 60%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
write_throttle_end_percent

 Maximum throttling will occur once this space threshold is reached, i.e.
 the throttling is now at its maximum effect.
 Typical values for this are 90%.

/mars/
\family default
 lies between 
\family typewriter
write_throttle_start_percent
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter

\family default
, the strength of throttling will be interpolated linearly between the extremes.
 In practice, this should lead to an equilibrum between new input flow into

 The measuring window is the timespan for which the average (throughput)

\begin_layout Standard
When

 of any local transaction logfile (or free some space in any other way),
 there is only one exit strategy: stop creating new logfile data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that the ability for replication gets lost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When entering emergency mode, the kernel module will execute the following
 steps for all resources where the affected host is acting as a primary:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Do a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

logrotate
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

new
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 logfile is left empty, i.e.
 no data ist written to it (for now).
 The hole in the numbering will prevent any secondaries from applying any
 logfiles behind the hole (should they ever contain some data, e.g.
 because the emergency mode has been left again).
 This works because the secondaries are regularly checking the logfile numbers
 for contiguity, and they will refuse to apply anything which is not contiguous.
 As a result, the secondaries will be left in a consistent, but outdated
 state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The kernel module writes back all data present in the temporary memory buffer
 (see figure in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Transaction-Logger"

\end_inset

).
 This may lead to a (short) delay of user write requests until that has
 finished (typically fractions of a second or a few seconds).
 The reason is that the temporary memory buffer must not be increased in
 parallel during this phase (race conditions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
After the temporary memory buffer is empty, all local IO requests (whether
 reads or writes) are directly going to the underlying disk.
 This has the same effect as if MARS was not present anymore.

By default,

marsadm

 always uses the IP for

$host
\family default
 as stored in the symlink tree (directory

 When such an IP entry does not (yet) exist (e.g.

create-cluster

join-cluster
\family default
), all local network interfaces are automatically scanned for IPv4 adresses,
 and the first one is taken.
 This may lead to wrong decisions if you have multiple network interfaces.

 THIS COMMAND IS 
\emph on
VERY
\emph default
 DANGEROUS!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
Use this only in desperate situations.
 You are forcefully using a sledgehammer, even without 
\family typewriter
--force
\family default
! The danger is that the 
\emph on
true
\emph default
 state of other cluster nodes need not be known in case of network problems
 .Even when it were known, it could be compromised by 
\series bold
byzantine failures
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
It is strongly advised to try this command with 
\family typewriter
--dry-run
\family default
 first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
When combined with 
\family typewriter
--force
\family default
, this command will definitely 
\series bold
murder
\series default
 other cluster nodes, possibly after a long while, and even when they are
 operating in primary mode / having split brains / etc.
 However, there is no guarantee that other cluster nodes will be 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 dead - it is possible that they remain only 
\emph on
half
\emph default
 
\emph on
dead
\emph default
.
 For example, a half dead node may continue to write data to 
\family typewriter
/mars/
\family default
 and thus lead to overflow somewhen.

This command implies a forceful detach, possibly destroying consistency.
 
\size scriptsize
In particular, when a cluster node was operating in primary mode (
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 being continuously in use), the forceful detach cannot be carried out until
 the device is completely unused.
 In the meantime, the current transaction logfile will be appended to, but
 the file 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 be already unlinked (orphan file filling up the disk).
 After the forceful detach, the underlying disk need not be consistent (although
 we do our best).
 Since this command deletes any symlinks which normally would indicate the
 consistency state, no guarantees about consistency can be given after this
 
\emph on
in general
\emph default
! Always check consistency by hand!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
When possible / as soon as possible, check the local state on the other
 nodes in order to 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 shutdown the resource everywhere (e.g.
 to 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 unuse the 
\family typewriter
/dev/mars/mydata
\family default
 device, etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size scriptsize
After this command, you 
\emph on
should
\emph default
 rebuild the resource under a different name, in order to avoid any clashes
 caused by unexpected resurrection of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dead
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

half-dead
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 nodes (beware of shapshot / restores on virtual machines!!).
 MARS Light does its best to avoid problems even in case the new resource
 name should equal the old one, but there can be 
\emph on
no guarantee
\emph default
 in all possible failure scenarios / usage scenarios.

When another host is currently primary, it is first asked to become secondary,

 After that, the local host is asked to become primary.
 Before actually becoming primary, all relevant logfiles are applied.
 Only after that,

 When netwrk transfers of the symlink tree are very slow (or currently impossibl

 will skip all checks depending on remote state.

\begin_layout Chapter
MARS for Developers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter is organized strictly top-down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are a sysadmin and want to inform yourself about internals (useful
 for debugging), the relevant information is at the beginning, and you don't
 need to dive into all technical details at the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are a kernel developer and want to contribute code to the emerging
 MARS community, please read it (almost) all.
 Due to the top-down organization, sometimes you will need to follow some
 forward references in order to understand details.
 Therefore I recommend reading this chapter twice in two different reading
 modes: in the first reading pass, you just get a raw network of principles
 and structures in your brain (you don't want to grasp details, therefore
 don't strive for a full understanding).
 In the second pass, you will exploit your knowlegde from the first pass
 for a deeper understanding of the details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, you may first read the sections about general architecture,
 and then start a bottom-up scan by first reading the last section about
 generic objects and aspects, and working in reverse 
\emph on

 order (but read 
\emph on
sub

sections in-order) until you finally reach the kernel interfaces / symlink
 trees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Motivation / Politics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MARS is not yet upstream in the Linux kernel.
 This section tries to clear up some potential doubts.
 Some people have asked why MARS uses its own internal framework instead
 of 
\emph on
directly
\emph default

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that 
\emph on

 However, such bricks are not portable to other environments like userspace.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 being based on some already existing Linux kernel infrastructures like
 the device mapper.
 Here is a list of technical reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The existing device mapper infrastructure is based on 
\family typewriter
struct bio
\family default
.
 In contrast, the new XIO personality of the generic brick infrastructure
 is based on the concept of AIO (Asynchronous IO), which is a 
\series bold
true superset
\series default
 of block IO.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In particular, 
\family typewriter
struct bio
\family default
 is firmly referencing to 
\family typewriter
struct page
\family default
 (via intermediate 
\family typewriter
struct bio_vec
\family default
), using types like 
\family typewriter
sector_t
\family default
 in the field 
\family typewriter
bi_sector
\family default
.
 Basic transfer units are blocks, or sectors, or pages, or the like.
 In contrast, 
\family typewriter
struct aio_object
\family default
 used by the XIO personality can address 
\series bold
arbitrary granularity
\series default
 memory with byte resolution even at odd
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some brick 
\emph on
implementations
\emph default
 (as opposed to the capabilities of the 
\emph on
interface
\emph default
) may be (and, in fact, 
\emph on
are
\emph default
) restricted to 
\family typewriter
PAGE_SIZE
\family default
 operations or the like.
 This is no general problem, because IOP can automatically insert some translato
r bricks extending the capabilities to universal granularity (of course
 at some performance costs).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 positions in (virtual) files / devices, similar to classical Unix file
 IO, but 
\emph on

\emph default
.
 Practical experience shows that even non-functional properties like performance
 of many datacenter workloads are profiting from that

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The current transaction logger uses variable-sized headers at

 Although this increases 
\family typewriter
memcpy()
\family default
 load due to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

misalignment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the 
\emph on
overall performance
\emph default
 was provably better than in variants where sector / page alignment was
 strictly obeyed, but space was wasted for alignments.
 Such functionality is only possible if the XIO infrastructure 
\emph on
allows
\emph default
 
\emph on
for
\emph default
 (but doesn't force) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mis-aligned
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 IO operations.
 In future, many different transaction logfile formats showing different
 runtime behaviour (e.g.
 optimized for high-throughput SSD loads) may co-exist in parallel.
 Note that properly aligned XIO operations bear no noticeable overhead compared
 to classical block IO, at least in typical datacenter RAID scenarios.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The AIO/XIO abstraction contains no fixed link to kernel abstractions and
 should be 
\series bold
easily portable
\series default
 to other environments.
 In summary, the new personality provides a uniform abstraction which abstracts
 away from multiple different kernel interfaces; it is designed to be useful
 even in userspace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Kernel infrastructures for the concept of 
\emph on
direct IO
\emph default
 are different from those for 
\emph on
buffered IO
\emph default
.
 The XIO personality used by MARS subsumes both concepts as use case 
\emph on
variants
\emph default
.
 
\series bold
Buffering
\series default
 is an optional internal property of XIO bricks (almost non-functional property
 with support for consistency guarantees).

 However, this may be undesirable in case of fatal crashes.
 Therefore, abort operations are also configurable, as well as network timeouts
 which are then mapped to classical IO errors.
\end_layout

) no semantic differences to local operations (built-in
\series bold
 network transparency
\series default
).
 There are universal provisions for mixed operation of different versions
 (
\series bold
rolling software updates
\series default
 in clusters / grids).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The generic brick infrastructure (as well as its personalities like XIO
 or any other future personality) supports 
\series bold
dynamic re-wiring / re-configuration
\series default
 
\emph on
during
\emph default
 operation (even while parallel IO requests are flying, some of them taking
 different paths in the IO stack in parallel).
 This is absolutely needed for MARS Light logfile rotation.
 In the long term, this would be useful for many advanced new features and
 products, not limited to multipathing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The generic brick infrastructure (and in turn all personalities) provide
 
\series bold
additional comfort

 to the programmer while enabling

increased functionality

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Similar to AOP, insertion of IOP bricks for checking / debugging etc is
 one of the key advantages of the generic brick infrastructure.
 In contrast to AOP where debugging is usually {en,dis}abled statically
 at compile time, IOP allows for 
\emph on
dynamic
\emph default
 (re-)configuration of debugging bricks, automatic repair, and many more
 features promoted by 
\emph on

\end_layout

\end_inset

, the programmer need no longer worry about dynamic memory allocations for
 
\emph on
local state
\emph default
 in a brick instance.
 MARS is 
\series bold
automating local state
\series default
 even when dynamically instantiating new bricks (possibly having the same
 brick type) at runtime.
 Specifially, XIO is automating 
\series bold
request stacking
\series default
 at the completion path this way, even while dynamically reconfiguring the
 IO stack
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The generic aspect orientation approach leads to better 
\series bold
separation of concerns
\series default
: local state needed by brick implementations is not visible from outside
 by default.
 In other words, local state is also 
\series bold
private state
\series default
.
 Accidental hampering of internal operations is impeded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Example from the kernel: in 
\family typewriter
include/linux/blkdev.h
\family default
 the definition of 
\family typewriter
struct request
\family default
 contains the following comment: 
\family typewriter
/* the following two fields are internal, NEVER access directly */
\family default
.
 It appears that 
\family typewriter
struct request
\family default
 contains not only fields relevant for the caller, but also 
\series bold
internal fields
\series default
 needed only in 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 
\emph on
specific
\emph default
 callees.
 For example, 
\family typewriter
rb_node
\family default
 is documented to be used only in IO schedulers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
XIO goes one step further: there need not exist exactly one IO scheduler
 instance in the IO stack for a single device.
 Future 
\family typewriter
xio_scheduler_{deadline,cfq,...}
\family default
 brick types could be each instantiated many times, and in arbitrary places,
 even for the same (logical) device.
 The equivalent of 
\family typewriter
rb_node
\family default
 would then be automatically instantiated multiple times for the same IO
 request, by automatically instantiating the right local aspect instances.
